Algorithm

The Program was similar to our last assignment so I used vectors again as my choice of 
data storage

1.	I Started with making each of the appropriate files for the project,
BankAccount.cpp, BankAccount.h, Project3.cpp, and Project3.h

2.	First, I started making the Switch Case as the menu for the Bank menu.

3.	After I finished the switch case with, Open, Deposit, Withdraw, Fast trasnfer, Print, and Exit
I slowly worked my way down the list to make a function for each.

4.	I started making the class for Accounts, 3 private members and the rest
are public functions.

5.	I started with the Open account function first,
I created the new object using the constructor, I made it so as each account number
is made it will increment to the next value after 1000. After the constructor was made, 
I pushed it back to the vector to store the information.

6.	I then made the deposit function; it was simply a For loop to read
through the Account numbers and find the one you’re
trying to change and then using that account number to set the new value after
money has been added.

7.	After, I made the Withdraw function and it was the same as the deposit but just the opposite because it took out money. I made it so if there’s not enough in the bank then it wouldn’t work.

8.  Finally the fast withdraw wasn't super hard but I had issue with the withdraw withdrawing 40 anyways if only one account was found but i made a loop to test and make sure both accounts where found before anything was removed or added.

9.	The print function was pretty easy, I ran a for loop to iterate through each Account and print out the information in order.
